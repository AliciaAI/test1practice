          <dt><strong>background-color</strong></dt>
            <dd>I used this property to set the color of the nav element. I set it to aliceblue</dd>
          <dt><strong>background-image</strong></dt>
            <dd>I used linear gradient to all the paragraphs of class gradpar. I selected 5 colors (light shades of blue). I also used url to setup an image in the background of the header.</dd>
            <dd>I also used url to setup an image in the background of the header of this website.</dd>
          <dt><strong>background-repeat</strong></dt>
            <dd>I set it to 'repeat' for the image of my header. Now the image is repeated until it covers all the area of my header</dd>
          <dt><strong>border</strong></dt>
            <dd>I added a border for all my links. The type of the border is solid and the color is green</dd>
          <dt><strong>box-shadow</strong></dt>
            <dd>I inserted an image (see figure 1 below) and added a shadow</dd>  
          <dt><strong>float</strong></dt>
            <dd>I created a div element that takes only 50% of the width of this page. I set its left and right margins to 'auto' because I wanted to centralise it. I then inserted a photo to cover all its background by setting background-size to 'cover'</dd>   
          <dt><strong>hr</strong></dt>
            <dd>I added an hr element to separate between two sections on this page: the main from the footer</dd>   
            <dt><strong>margin</strong></dt>
            <dd>I set a negative value to the margin-top of the logo I inserted in the header of this page because I wanted it to start displaying outside of the border of the header element</dd> 
            <dt><strong>padding</strong></dt>
            <dd>I added an .5em padding to all my links because I set their background-color to black and their color to white and I wanted to create space around the links' text</dd>
